# CtCI - Swift

Solutions to selected problems from _Cracking the Coding Interview_ book implemented in Swift programming language.

Each chapter is implemented in its own Xcode playground compatible with Swift 4.

I don't try to make these solutions as optimized and documented as possible, this is just a bunch of exercises I sometimes do for myself in a spare time to keep in shape.
